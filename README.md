# Sep2016_CodeLouisvillePHP
My project
The database is included in the folder Dataexport
it is a .sql file which would need to be imported. It is titled Eats.sql. 
Folder CSS is required , Folder removed is not. 

File to open is index.php. Should open directly to the project. 
The project is an Exercise log which tracks exercises and data. Data is updatable on the form itself. 
Also includes sorts by groups via button. 

User has ability to set exercises as inactive either through a drop down form individually or all through a button(Clear).
Inactive items appear at bottom of page and are greyed out. 
Additionally, user has ability to set exercises as active either through a drop down form individually or all through a button(Add all).

User can add data via a link and form. (Add an exercise). User has ability to change mind and return to main page without adding data. 
 
Note: I have intentionally ommited ability for user to Delete records. I did leave functions in the code to that purpose, but they are unused. 

There is room for expansion in this project. One item for later is to add the ability to use the current date as the last date. 
I also forsee updating the display method.
